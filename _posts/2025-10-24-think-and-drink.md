title: "Think & Drink at ISTA: How to Find a Black Hole"
---

I recently gave a talk in the "Think and Drink" seminar series at ISTA, my institution. This is an institute-wide event where researchers from different fields present their past and current work to a broad audience of scientists with diverse backgrounds — from biology to computer science, applied physics, neuroscience, and more.  The title of my talk was *How to Find a Black Hole*, and I discussed the various observational techniques that astronomers use to detect black holes and study their properties, such as tracking the orbits of stars around the Galactic center, spotting *tidal disruption events*, detecting gravitational waves, or analyzing the spectral properties of quasars, among others. I chose this topic because I think black holes are often seen as enigmatic and misunderstood objects by the general audience. Many people believe that black holes are simply *black*, and that there’s no way to actually *see* them!
