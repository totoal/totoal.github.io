### *A weak LyÎ± halo for an extremely bright Little Red Dot. Indications of enshrouded SMBH growth*
[arXiv:2505.09542](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09542)

Using data from the VLT/MUSE spectrometer, we studied the Lyman-alpha extended emission of the most luminous Little Red Dot known to the date of publication: *The Monster*, at z = 4.46. We found that the Lyman-alpha halo of this object is very weak in comparison to those of quasars with similar H-alpha luminosities. This result suggests that little ionizing radiation is escaping from the LRD's central engine, which may be enshrouded by a dense-gas envelope with a high covering factor.
