# Extragalactic astrophysics researcher

Hi! I‚Äôm Alberto Torralba Torregrosa, a postdoctoral researcher currently based in Vienna. Originally from Valencia, Spain, I completed my Bachelor's in Physics, as well as my Master‚Äôs and PhD, at the Universitat de Val√®ncia. My research focuses on observational extragalactic astrophysics, especially on young, star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the cosmic dawn to cosmic noon.

Outside of science, I‚Äôm passionate about movies and love going to the cinema whenever I can. In my free time, I also play electric guitar and bass.
