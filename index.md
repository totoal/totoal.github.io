# Extragalactic astrophysics researcher

Hi! My name is Alberto Torralba Torregrosa. I'm a post-doctoral researcher currently based in Vienna. I was born in Valencia, Spain,and obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics, Master's and PhD in Universitat de Val√®ncia. My field of research is Observational extragalactic astrophysics. In particular, observations of young star-forming galaxies and AGN from cosmic dawn to noon.

Apart from science, I love movies. I go to the cinema everytime I can. In my spare time I also play electric guitar and bass.
